I'm Tom Niget (pronounced /ni.ʒɛ/), I'm 20, living in France and currently studying for an engineering degree in Computer Science at the [Sophia Antipolis engineering graduate school (Polytech Nice)](https://polytech.univ-cotedazur.fr/).

Throughout the years, I've wandered in many areas of the world of computers; from [budgeting software](https://github.com/zdimension/CrediNET) to [disk management utilities](https://github.com/zdimension/SharpBoot), from [real-time image processing](https://github.com/zdimension/tpepeip1) to [logic programming](https://github.com/zdimension/si4-s8-options), from [type theory](https://github.com/zdimension/hm-infer-scheme) to [digital circuits](https://github.com/zdimension/logisim-pong). I've written [programming languages](https://github.com/HassiumTeam/Hassium), [a Python IDE](https://github.com/TuringApp/Turing), a [game](https://github.com/zdimension/wordle-ce) for TI-84 calculators, [low-level drivers](https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos) for a managed kernel, and run [Rust code on logic circuits](https://twitter.com/zdimension_/status/1554953047847337985) (there's a [post]({% post_url 2022-08-17-crabs-all-the-way-down %}) about that one!).

I won first place in a [European CTF competition](https://esisar.grenoble-inp.fr/en/about/csaw-results) with some friends while in high school, my work has been featured in [a CS teachers journal](https://www.epi.asso.fr/revue/lu/l1806n.htm) (in French) and [a Kotaku article](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2018/02/decompiled-tomb-raider-source-code-reveals-loads-of-vulgar-commentary/), and I've [front-paged /r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/t0pzxb/tired_of_safe_programming_embed_c_directly_in/) with a [cursed Rust crate](https://github.com/zdimension/embed-c).

# What is this?

This is my blog. I write about things I find interesting, or things I've done. I try to write about things that I would have liked to read about when I was looking for information on the topic. There will be long posts, short posts, and posts that are just a link to something I found interesting.
